# Predicting-Song-Success
For aspiring artists, creating a hit song is almost universally regarded as the ultimate
goal. However, it seems almost impossible to predict which songs will eventually go viral. As
current music varies greatly in terms of tempo, energy, lyrics, and genre, among other
characteristics, predicting song success requires careful consideration of how each of these
variables contributes to the overall possibility of the song becoming popular. This project
aims to utilize song component data, obtained from a Spotify API called SpotiPy, of
approximately 40,000 songs created in the past five decades to develop a
model which can predict whether a particular song will become popular based on its own
components.
